This is a very simple memory leak detector for C.

To use:

1. Simply include mem.h from C files where memory 
is managed  using malloc, calloc, realloc and free.
2. Link libmemd.a to the executable.

Example:

#include <stdlib.h>
#include "mem.h"

int main() { 
        void *p;
        
        p = malloc(10); //This will leak
}

Run the executable. For each unfreed memory buffer, a .mem file will be 
created. For example if memory address 0x7fb1d2403960 leaks, then a file 
called 0x7fb1d2403960.mem will be left behind after the application exits.

The file will have information about where the memory was allocated and
the size of the buffer. For example:

File: test.c
Line: 7
Size: 10 bytes

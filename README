This is a very simple memory leak detector for C.

To use:

1. Simply include mem.h from a file where memory is allocation
is managed  using malloc, calloc, realloc and free.
2. Link libmemd.a to the executable.

Run the executable. If there is any unfreed memory, a .mem file will be 
created. For example if memory address 0x7fb1d2403960 leaks, then a file 
called 0x7fb1d2403960.mem will be left behind after the application exits.

The file will have information about where the memory was allocated and
the size of the buffer. For example:

File: test.c
Line: 9
Size: 20 bytes
